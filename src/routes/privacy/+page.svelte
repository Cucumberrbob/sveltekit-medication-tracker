				Under GDPR, you have a variety of rights about your personal data. You can request all the
				personal data an organisation holds on you, request deletion, reasonable amendments, and
				withdraw consent for data processing at any time.
			</p>
			<p>All of this is irrelevant if you use local mode. The data will never leave your device.</p>

			<p>
				We promise to never process your data without your explicit, informed consent. The app
				currently does not have functionality to process any data, but we may add the option in the
				future. We will never sell your data to third parties.

			<p>
				You can request that all your data is deleted by clicking on your username in the top right.
				In local mode, this is where the login button would be.
			</p>
			<p>
				You'll find the option to request all the data we hold on you in the same place. We only
				share a small amount of data with our Identity Provider, Auth0. We <span class="font-bold">

				a fake one will not allow you to reset your password).
